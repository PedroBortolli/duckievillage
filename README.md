# Duckievillage

Duckievillage is an adaptation of [Duckietown](https://duckietown.org)'s OpenAI Gym
[gym-duckietown](https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown) for the undergraduate level [Intro
to Robotics](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=MAC0318&nomdis=) (MAC0318)
course held at the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.ime.usp.br/) (IME) of the
[University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/#english) (USP).

This project is not to be thought of as a fork or standalone project, but as a complement to
Duckietown's Gym. To be more precise, Duckievillage's objectives are two-fold: to be an environment
wrapper around `DuckietownEnv`, which allows a more custom-made environment for our own robotics
course; and to be used as course walkthrough.

## Installation

Duckievillage requires [Python](https://www.python.org/), [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/),
[gym-duckietown](https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
installed. If you're on Arch Linux, you can easily install everything except `gym-duckietown`
through the AUR:

```bash
yay -S python-gym-git python-pytorch
```

If you're on another distribution or OS, the second easiest way is through
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Simply download and run the installer. Once that's done,
install PyTorch and OpenAI Gym:

```bash
conda create -n duckievillage
conda activate duckievillage
conda install pip
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=9.0 -c pytorch
pip3 install gym
```

To install `gym-duckietown`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown.git
cd gym-duckietown
pip3 install -e .
```

## Usage

To import Duckievillage, simply copy `duckievillage.py` to your working directory and import it:

```python
import duckievillage
```
