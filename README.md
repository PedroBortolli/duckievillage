# Duckievillage

![Duckievillage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RenatoGeh/duckievillage/master/duckieusp.png)

Duckievillage is an adaptation of [Duckietown](https://duckietown.org)'s OpenAI Gym
[gym-duckietown](https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown) for the undergraduate level [Intro
to Robotics](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=MAC0318&nomdis=) (MAC0318)
course held at the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.ime.usp.br/) (IME) of the
[University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/#english) (USP).

This project is not to be thought of as a fork or standalone project, but as a complement to
Duckietown's Gym. To be more precise, Duckievillage's objectives are two-fold: to be an environment
wrapper around `DuckietownEnv`, which allows a more custom-made environment for our own robotics
course; and to be used as course walkthrough.

## Installation

We'll cover installation through Anaconda.

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
2. `git clone https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown.git`
3. `cd gym-duckietown`
4. `conda env create -f environment.yaml`
5. `echo "export PYTHONPATH=\"\${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)\"" >> ~/.bashrc`
6. `cd ..`
7. `git clone https://github.com/RenatoGeh/duckievillage.git`
8. `cd duckievillage`

Before every terminal session, activate `gym-duckietown`'s environment:

```
source activate gym-duckietown
```

Test your environment:

```
python3 -m assignments.manual
```

You should see the environment for the first exercise.
