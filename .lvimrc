" Here are some standards we'll expect you to comply with.

" You can either append them to your .vimrc or create a temp .lvimrc inside this directory and
" somehow source it every time you start working on Dukievillage. The latter can be done either
" through a plugin (https://github.com/embear/vim-localvimrc) or by manually writing a function in
" your .vimrc.
"
" If you're using a different editor (or a different OS like Emacs), don't forget to apply these
" changes in their respective equivalents.

" These are a must. Otherwise Python might complain. Has to do with tab spacing and using spaces
" instead of tabs.

" Adds a colorcolumn to character 100, and sets vim to wrap text automatically when a line exceeds
" the limit of 99 characters.
set colorcolumn=100

" Adds line numbers to the left. Unless you're a masochist, this too is a must.
set nu

" This shows your currently typed in commands on Vim's bottom right corner. Useful when you have a
" short attention span/memory like me.
set showcmd

" Whenever you close brackets, curly braces or parentheses, showmatch highlights the opening
" bracket/curly brace/parenthesis. Somewhat useful. Your standard Vim syntax should already have
" MatchParen highlighted, so this is more a personal preference.
set showmatch

" This shows which mode (INSERT, NORMAL, VISUAL, etc.) you're currently in.
set showmode

" The latest in editor technology: syntax highlighting.

" Auto complete (with TAB) for Vim commands.
